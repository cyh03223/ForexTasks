# ForexTasks
## This is my personal practice of forex tasks about Python, Numpy and Pandas. Please feel free to share your valueable suggestion with me!

### Task 1: Get Forex Rate
Given a time range, return the average foreign exchange rate

### Task 2: Mock Golden Ratio
Given a date, writing a function to programmatically generates a fake ratio within [0,1]. Use this function to generate a smooth time series. The function should support 3 types of curves.

### Task 3: Implement a Backtesting
Use 10000 CAD as an initial balance, use get_golden_ratio and daily forex data to do a backtesting for a given time range. Output the daily balance as time series.
